# RAG & Roll Hands on Lab - Twilio Signal 2025

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll learn how to build an intelligent chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Twilio AI Assistants. In this 60-minute session, you'll create a fully functional AI assistant for a fictional car rental company that can answer customer queries using your company's knowledge base.

You'll see how Twilio AI Assistants dramatically simplifies the development process compared to traditional frameworks, allowing you to build production-ready AI applications in minutes rather than days.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding the limitations of standard LLMs and how RAG solves these challenges
- The core components of RAG architecture and how they work together
- How to implement RAG systems using two approaches:
    - The DIY approach with LangChain (demonstration only)
    - The accelerated approach with Twilio AI Assistants (hands-on)
- Best practices for designing effective AI assistants for real-world applications

## Hands-On Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Twilio Account

- Create or log in to your Twilio account
- Navigate to the AI Assistants section in the Twilio Console, if you don't see it, you will have to sign-up for [it here.](https://twilioalpha.com/ai-assistants)
- Create a new AI Assistants (we'll do this together during the workshop)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Knowledge Base

- We'll provide sample documents for our fictional car rental company "Silicon Valley Car Rentals"
- Documents include terms and conditions, vehicle inventory, and basic business information
- You'll learn how to upload and organize these documents

### Step 3: Configure Your Assistant

- Set up the assistant's personality and expertise

    ```md
    You are a helpful assistant to help rental car customers . You only rely on the context provided by you and don't make up any other facts. Reply with "I'm afraid I don't have information about this" if you donâ€™t know the answer.
    ```

- Configure response parameters
- Test capabilities using the simulator

### Step 4: Deploy Your AI Assistant

- Connect to communication channels (time permitting)
- Buy a Twilio Number for SMS/Voice Capabilities or you can also use WhatsApp Sandbox
- Use the Quick Deploy template [here.](https://www.twilio.com/code-exchange/ai-assistants-samples)
- For voice, we can use TwiML Bins

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Connect>
            <Assistant id="YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID" welcomeGreeting="Hi! Ask me anything!" voice="en-US-Journey-O"></Assistant>
     </Connect>
    </Response>
    ```

- Test with real-world scenarios

## Step 5: Tools for AI Assistant

- See how you can configure Tools for AI Assistant
- We will configure a dummy CRM API to get reservation details
