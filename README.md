# twilio-signal-rag-and-roll

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll learn how to build an intelligent chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Twilio AI Assistants. In this 60-minute session, you'll create a fully functional AI assistant for a fictional car rental company that can answer customer queries using your company's knowledge base.

You'll see how Twilio AI Assistants dramatically simplifies the development process compared to traditional frameworks, allowing you to build production-ready AI applications in minutes rather than days.

## What You'll Learn

-   Understanding the limitations of standard LLMs and how RAG solves these challenges
-   The core components of RAG architecture and how they work together
-   How to implement RAG systems using two approaches:
    -   The DIY approach with LangChain (demonstration only)
    -   The accelerated approach with Twilio AI Assistants (hands-on)
-   Best practices for designing effective AI assistants for real-world applications

## Prerequisites

To participate in the hands-on portion of this workshop, you'll need:

-   A laptop with internet access
-   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
